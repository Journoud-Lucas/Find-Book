Find Book is an application that lets you find the name of a book (and its author) from a photo of its cover.
A library could use it, for example, so that its users can take a photo of a book they own and see if the library has the same copy, thanks to this application.
You don't need to know the book's ISBN to be able to search for it, which can be useful for old or self-published books. 
The application works on the basis of a database of books containing their cover, the name of the book and the name of the author.
Once the user has selected a book photo, the algorithm compares the image with all those in the database using ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), calculating a match score for each image.
Once the entire database has been searched, the program will display the name of the book (as well as the author's name) on the cover with the highest match score with the photo of the book the user is looking for.

## üéì School project
This is a small project for [Universit√© Lumi√®re Lyon 2](https://www.univ-lyon2.fr/).
We had to work in pairs for 2 hours on a Python project using an image extraction and description algorithm with OpenCV.
